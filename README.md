# StartScan – Startup Outcome Predictor

StartScan is a machine learning project that predicts startup outcomes based on business-related features such as funding rounds, team size, and milestones.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Project Overview
- Collected and analyzed startup-related data
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
- Trained and evaluated a machine learning classification model
- Saved the trained model for prediction

## Files in this Repository
- `Startup_Success_Prediction.ipynb` – Main notebook for data analysis and model training
- `startscan.csv` – Dataset used for training
- `random_forest_model.pkl` – Trained machine learning model
- `app.py` – Application file for running predictions

## What I Learned
- Data preprocessing and feature handling
- Basics of machine learning workflows
- Working with real-world datasets
- Model training and evaluation
